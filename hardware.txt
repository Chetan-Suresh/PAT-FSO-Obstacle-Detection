How It Works

The audio signal is modulated and fed to the laser transmitter.
PAT system aligns the laser towards the receiver using a red marker.
The audio-carrying laser beam reaches the photodiode receiver, where it is demodulated back into audio.
The ESP32-CAM continuously checks for obstacles:
If obstacle detected → audio transmission stops
If clear → audio transmission resumes
This ensures a stable, line-of-sight audio communication link.
