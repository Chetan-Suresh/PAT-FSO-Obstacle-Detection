PAT Enabled FSO System with Obstacle Avoidance

This project implements a Free Space Optical (FSO) communication system capable of transmitting audio signals using a laser.
The system includes Pan and tilt (PAT) to maintain laser alignment and uses obstacle detection to stop audio transmission when the line-of-sight is blocked.
The goal is to achieve wireless, high-quality audio transmission using light.


Key Features:

Audio signal transmission over laser (FSO link)
PAT mechanism for maintaining correct laser alignment
Obstacle detection using ESP32-CAM
Automatic audio ON/OFF control based on visibility
Real-time red-marker tracking for alignment
Hardware-based audio modulation & demodulation
